# Pre-work study guide webpage

## Description
-My motivation for this project was to create a resourse I can always come back to for information.
-Because I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and the best way to learn to code is to... well...code!
-It solves the issue of not being able to find information quickly and with ease. It is all on one webpage. A single page API.
-I learned how to use HTML, Git, CSS, and some Javascript. Definitely feel more comfortable continuing with the bootcamp.
